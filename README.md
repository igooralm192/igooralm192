## 👋 Hi, I'm Igor Almeida

I'm a Fullstack Software Engineer with 7+ years of experience building high-quality web and mobile applications using **Node.js**, **React**, and **React Native**. I’m passionate about clean architecture, performance optimization, and developer experience.

### ⚒️ Core Skills
- 🔧 **Backend Development**: REST APIs, data modeling, background jobs, authentication, clean architecture
- 🖼️ **Frontend Engineering**: Component-driven UI, state management, reusable patterns, performance tuning
- 📐 **Architecture & Code Quality**: Scalable solutions, clean code principles, internal tooling for productivity
